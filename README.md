# minesweeper
Minesweeper game project written for C++ programming class with SFML library.

The classic computer game written from scratch in C++ and using the SFML for rendering.

A new game starts as soon as the program is run.
By default, games are generated randomly with certain parameters defined in the config.cfg file.
Left-click to reveal tiles and right-click to flag tiles.
A new game can be started at any time while the program is running by clicking the smiley face button.
When you win, the smiley face will don sunglasses (congratulations).
The mine/eye button can be pressed to make mines visible.
The 1, 2, or 3 button can be pressed to load a preset game from the /boards/ folder.

You can add your own preset boards or change the default parameters by editing the files in the /boards/ folder.

Please note that there are some known bugs, including the loss of clicking functionality after resizing the display.
The code written has a lot of beginner mistakes and is reflective of a time when I knew less about coding.
Everyone starts somewhere, though, and ultimately I'm proud to share my work.
